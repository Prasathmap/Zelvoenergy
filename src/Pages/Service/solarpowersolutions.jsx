             ZESPL builds the solar farm, OPEX module solar farm has zero upfront investment from consumer and consumer will pay the bill as per their usage of power at rates which are cheaper than prevailing grid electricity tariffs.

Solar OPEX represents a transformative financial approach to the funding and management of solar projects. In contrast to CAPEX, which necessitates a considerable initial investment, OPEX enables businesses to access solar energy without the burden of substantial upfront expenses. This model functions on a pay-as-you-go framework, thereby enhancing the affordability and feasibility of solar energy for a diverse range of companies and institutions.

ZESPL offers an exceptional opportunity for clients seeking to capitalize on the benefits of solar energy without incurring significant upfront costs. Uneecops will oversee the installation process, with the only requirement being that the customer provides suitable roof space. Furthermore, clients can take advantage of highly competitive pricing, paying exclusively for the solar energy generated on a per-unit basis, which significantly reduces their expenses related to the utility grid.
